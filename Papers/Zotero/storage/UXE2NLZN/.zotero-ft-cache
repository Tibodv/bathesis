Summary

This chapter examines the growing phenomenon of e-recruiting and reviews the relevant theory and empirical research examining this area of interest. It also proposes a framework for studying this phenomenon, which will guide future research in this exciting area. It also discusses both e-recruiting and applicant reactions to technology driven selection practices. The chapter reviews the history of e-recruiting and its emergence in the field. It discusses the potential benefits of e-recruiting for organizations. Despite the growing popularity and potential of e-recruiting, there is a dearth of research on the efficacy of these approaches for employee recruitment. Available research on applicant reactions gives some information about the implementation of e-recruiting and particularly the use of online data and technologies for screening and selection. The goals of e-recruiting are largely the same as traditional recruiting; that is, attracting job applicants, maintaining applicant interest and ultimately influencing their job choices.
