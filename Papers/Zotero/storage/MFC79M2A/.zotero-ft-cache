Abstract
AI chatbots have been widely applied in the frontline to serve customers. Yet, the existing dimensions and scales of service quality can hardly fit the new AI environment. To address this gap, we define the dimensions of AI chatbot service quality (AICSQ) and develop the associated scales with a mixed-method approach. In the qualitative analysis, with the coding of the interviews from 55 global organizations in 17 countries and 47 customers, we develop new multi-level dimensions of AICSQ, including seven second-order and 18 first-order constructs. Then we follow a 10-step scale development method to establish the valid scales. The nomological test result shows that AICSQ positively influences customers’ satisfaction with, perceived value of, and intention of continuous use of AI chatbots. The innovative dimensions and scales of AI chatbot service quality provide conceptual classification and measurement instruments for the future study of chatbot service in the frontline.
Introduction
A growing number of organizations adopt artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to serve customers in the frontline (De Keyser et al., 2019). Gartner (2019) shows that by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions globally will be completely handled by AI, which is an increase of 400% from 2017 (Gartner, 2019). Besides, according to the “2019 China Artificial Intelligence Industry Research Report” released by the China Economic and Information Research Center in December 2019, the scale of AI chatbot business reached 2.72 billion yuan in 2018, and it is expected that the number will exceed 16 billion yuan in 2022 (China Economic and Information Research Center, 2019). The new frontline service providers of AI chatbots are different from human customer service as well as self-service technology (SST). Combining advanced technologies that include natural language processing (NLP), cloud, machine learning, and biometrics, AI chatbots not only provide customers immediate and consistent services but also reduce the operating costs for organizations (Deloitte., 2018a, Wirtz et al., 2018). Previous studies already show that, in traditional service, the service quality of frontline employees who directly contact customers will significantly affect customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, and organization profits (Arora and Narula, 2018, Cenfetelli et al., 2008, Maklan et al., 2017, Piercy, 2014). Despite the growing attention to AI service quality in practice and academics (Jörling et al., 2019, Luo et al., 2019, Thomaz et al., 2020), the conception of AI chatbot service quality and the related evaluation instruments are still unclear (De Keyser et al., 2019), leading to the lack of theoretical perspective to evaluate and improve AI chatbot service quality (AICSQ). Since the conception, dimension, and measurement are vital to the research on service quality, many researchers study the classification and scale of service quality. A widely-used scale of service quality is SERVQUAL proposed by Parasuraman et al. (1988). This scale is verified in various online and offline contexts. Other researchers also developed service quality dimensions and scales specifically for online shopping, E-service, or information systems, such as Cox and Dale, 2001, Wolfinbarger and Gilly, 2003, Collier and Bienstock (2006), Xu et al. (2013), and Tan et al. (2017). However, these dimensions and scales of service quality are challenged when applied to the context of AI chatbot service. First, compared with human customer service, the AI chatbot service is based on an advanced information system. The existing dimensions of human customer service quality, such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, cannot fully reflect the innovative technical characteristics of AI chatbot service. Second, compared with websites or information systems, the AI chatbot has human-like intelligence, such as language intelligence and recognition capabilities, which are not shown in the existing studies. This study theoretically classifies and develops scales of AICSQ, which provide a framework and benchmark for evaluating, designing, and improving AI chatbot service quality for practitioners. To extend the service quality research to consider the quality evaluation in the AI environment, the research questions of this study are: (1) What are the dimensions of AI chatbot service quality? (2) How to measure AI chatbot service quality?
To build a validated measurement model of AI chatbot service quality, we adopted a mixed-method approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative section aims to classify the dimensions of AICSQ. We used the coding technique of grounded theory to analyze the semi-structured interview data, which are collected from both organizations and customers. Then we adopted a quantitative method to develop the AICSQ scale and tested the discriminant, convergent, predictive validity, and reliability of the measurement model. We obtained an AICSQ scale with good reliability and validity through the three-round of data collections and statistical tests: pretest, refine and validation, and nomological test.
Our research contributes to service quality studies, AI service science, and practical applications in business. Theoretically, the multi-dimensional measures of AICSQ solve the problem that the existing service quality dimension cannot comprehensively reflect the AI chatbot service context. Empirically, we introduce new validated scales for AICSQ, providing a measurement instrument for future empirical studies on AI chatbot service, especially the role of AI chatbot service quality in customer satisfaction and business outcomes. In practice, the dimension and scale of AICSQ we developed also play an important role in AI chatbot development phases, including investigating, designing, developing, evaluating, and customer relationship maintenance.

Concept, dimensions, and measurement of service quality
From service creation to service delivery, the service process involves two types of subjects: service providers (organizations) and service users (customers). Regarding the definition of service quality, from the perspective of a customer, service quality is a perception and is an overall subjective evaluation of the service in the interactive process of service delivery (Dabholkar et al., 2000, Parasuraman et al., 1988). From an organization’s perspective, service quality is evaluated by the
AI chatbot service quality (AICSQ) scale development
The AICSQ scale development took three phases. In phase 1, we developed the multiple-level dimension of AICSQ by adopting the coding method of grounded theory, which is suitable for studying under-researched and emerging phenomena (Corbin & Strauss, 1990). Phase 2 and phase 3 are the quantitative sections of AICSQ scale development. Following the ten-step method of scale development (Mackenzie et al., 2011), we obtained AICSQ with reliability and validity in phase 2, then conducted a
Discussion
As AI chatbots enter the frontline to service customers and service quality is vital to organizations, the existing dimensions and scales of service quality are challenged. This study establishes the dimension system of AICSQ based on clarifying the unique characteristics of AI chatbot service and develops the associated scale. We adopt an integrated perspective of organizations and users to conduct this study, avoiding the bias under a single view. This dual perspective is mainly reflected in
Conclusion
This study established the multi-level dimensions of AICSQ and developed the associate scales by adopting the mixed-method approach. Based on the interview data from both organizations and customers, we conducted open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. Finally, we obtained a seven second-order-dimension and 18 first-order sub-dimension AICSQ classification system. The ten-step method was adopted to develop the measurement scale. After obtaining a reliability and validity scale, we

Citation Excerpt :

Moreover, our study uniquely integrates and empirically investigates both university students and office workers, providing a comparative perspective across these two significant user groups. Earlier research has mainly focused on either educational or business settings individually, such as Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola (2021) examining AI's use in education, and Chen et al. (2022) and Chung et al. (2020) investigating AI in business contexts. Our study thus fills a gap by jointly considering these two important demographics and their interaction with AI systems, thereby broadly extending our understanding of the dynamics of AI usage across different user contexts.
