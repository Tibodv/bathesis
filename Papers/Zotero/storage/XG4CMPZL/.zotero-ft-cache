Abstract
The extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is less than ten years old and has already garnered more than 6000 citations with extensive usage in information systems and beyond. This research employed cited reference search to systematically review studies that cited UTAUT2 originating article. Based on UTAUT2 usage, the downloaded articles were classified into four categories such as: 1) General citation, 2) UTAUT2 application, 3) UTAUT2 integration, and 4) UTAUT2 extensions. Weber's (2012) theory evaluation framework revealed UTAUT2 as a robust theory on most dimensions except for parsimony arising from the complex model. UTAUT2 extensions emerged as popular UTAUT2 utilization category as researchers extended the model with context specific variables. Finally, UTAUT2 extensions were mapped to Johns' (2006) context dimensions to identify various limitations of the existing technology adoption research and to provide multi-level framework for future researchers with libraries of context dimensions.
Introduction
The advent of Internet and smartphones in 21st century has made information technologies an indispensable part of human life, that were mostly available only to organisational users during the late 20th century. Technology adoption and diffusion research is a mature stream of exploration within the contemporary information systems (IS) literature and IS researchers are in continuous quest to understand various factors influencing individual acceptance and use of emerging information technology (IT) (Hughes et al., 2016, 2017, Hughes et al., 2020). This widespread research stream has witnessed assortment of research methodologies examining multitude of technologies in range of countries with the extant literature revealing numerous theories, contexts, units of analysis and research methods (Dwivedi & Williams, 2008; Choudrie & Dwivedi, 2005; Williams et al., 2009). The varying research contexts based on technology, user type, location, adoption time and task performed gave rise to many competing theories and models. For instance, Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation (DoI), Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and Task Technology Fit (TTF) Theory that were mostly deployed to examine assortment of adoption and diffusion-related issues (Dwivedi et al., 2006, 2007; Dwivedi and Weerakkody, 2007; Kapoor et al., 2014). Based on exhaustive review of eight dominant technology adoption models, Venkatesh et al. (2003) developed unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) in the organisational context emphasising on the utilitarian value (extrinsic motivation) of organisational users after elimination of similar/redundant constructs (see Venkatesh et al., 2003 for review). The rise of consumer technologies necessitated the extension of UTAUT model to consumer context emphasising on hedonic value (intrinsic motivation) of technology users. This led to incorporation of three new constructs such as hedonic motivation, price value, and habit to original UTAUT, the new extended version is popularly refereed as UTAUT2. However, in UTAUT2, voluntariness of use was dropped as moderator since consumers have no organisational mandate and in many situations, consumer behaviour is voluntary (Venkatesh et al., 2012). The predictive ability of UTAUT2 theory is much higher in comparison to UTAUT; explaining about 74 percent of the variance on consumers’ behavioural intention to and 52 percent of the variance in consumers’ technology usage of focal technology (Venkatesh et al., 2016).
Despite UTAUT2 model recent introduction in the year 2012, it has already garnered more than 6000 citations in Google Scholar alone spanning from IS field and beyond emphasising on its predictive ability. This provides relevance for researchers to employ UTAUT2 as theoretical lens for understanding technology adoption related issues in variety of settings either stand-alone, or in combination with other theories, or with addition of external variables. UTAUT2 studies are not confined only to the consumer user type alone. Researchers have deployed UTAUT2 to examine various users types such as “Citizens” adoption to m-health (Dwivedi et al., 2016), “nurses” willingness to home tele-health (Van Houwelingen et al., 2014). Recent outburst of mobile subscribers is fuelling the growth of information and communication technology (ICT) worldwide, mobile has become the highest scale of adopted consumer technology worldwide representing two thirds of global population reaching 5 billion unique mobile subscribers in the year 2017 covering individual technology users from all the spectrum of the society (Baabdullah et al., 2019; Gsmaintelligence, 2017; Slade et al., 2013, 2014; Tamilmani et al., 2018a, Tamilmani et al., 2018b). This has given rise to numerous technology companies such as Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft in the same order emerging as three topmost-valued organisations across the globe based on market capitalization (PWC, 2017). This provides exciting context for individual technology acceptance and use research and what lies ahead in future. Given UTAUT2 central role in individual technology adoption research, a systematic review of the existing UTAUT2 studies will reveal the limitations of the model and provide fruitful directions for future research. This study objective will be achieved through following steps: 1) Locating studies that cited UTAUT2 theory using cited reference search method, 2) Systematically review and classify UTAUT2 cited articles based on model usage, 3) UTAUT2 theory evaluation using Weber's (2012) framework both on the parts of the theory and as a whole, 4) Synthesise UTAUT2 extensions using Johns' (2006) context dimension to identify future research directions, and 5) finally propose a multi-level framework of technology acceptance and use with libraries of context for future research.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the literature review the process employed in this study. Section 3 synthesises UTAUT2 literature into various types based on its citation type. Section 4 deploys Weber's (2012) framework and Johns' (2006) context dimension to evaluate UTAUT2 theory robustness and its utilization types. Section 5 integrates frameworks in Section 4 and synthesises UTAUT2 extensions to propose multi-level framework. Section 6 provide research propositions and future research directions. Finally, the paper ends with conclusion in Section 7.

Literature review
This study employed combination of systematic review and “cited reference search” method for Venkatesh et al. (2012) UTAUT2 article in Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases from March 2012 to March 2017 (Alsudairi & Dwivedi, 2010; Gurzki & Woisetschlaeger, 2017; Pina et al., 2013; Tamilmani et al., 2020; Toufaily et al., 2013; Waseem et al., 2018). The cited reference search for UTAUT2 returned 1320 results in total: 497 citations from Web of Science and the remaining majority of
UTAUT2 literature synthesis
Researchers in their quest to understand individual technology acceptance and use have either applied, integrated, and extended UTAUT2 across variety of settings. These could be broadly grouped into six categories such as: 1) different types of users, 2) different types of organisation, 3) different types of technology, 4) different task types, 5) different times, and 6) different locations. The first group comprises of multiple technological users in myriad settings such as employees use of
Development and evaluation of IS theories
Weber (2012) provides a systematic framework to both evaluate existing theories and develop new IS theories that align well with overall aims and objectives of this research (i.e. to evaluate robustness of UTAUT2 theory and its usage patterns). The framework is already used to evaluate popular IS theories such as virtuality and knowledge in teams (Griffith et al., 2003) and UTAUT (Dwivedi et al., 2017, 2020; Rana et al., 2016, Rana et al., 2017a, Rana et al., 2017b; Venkatesh et al., 2003; 
Extended multi-level framework– mapping UTAUT2 extensions
This study mapped UTAUT2 extensions and extended Venkatesh et al. (2016) multi-level framework of technology acceptance and use based on Weber (2012) theory evaluation and thorough analysis of Johns (2006) context dimensions. The resultant model emerging from literature synthesis of UTAUT2 extensions is depicted in the Fig. 2. Five out of seven UTAUT2 exogenous constructs i.e. PE, EE, PV, HM and SI are classified as individual beliefs in the multi-level framework model. The simplified model is
Technology acceptance research – Recommendations and future research directions
The extended Venkatesh et al. (2016) multi-level framework of technology acceptance and use depicted in Fig. 2 mapped with UTAUT2 extensions can be leveraged to provide fruitful future research directions as shown by the double arrows based on Weber (2012) framework and Johns (2006) context dimensions.
The evaluation of UTAUT2 extensions parts using Weber (2012) revealed majority of the studies added novelty through addition/deletion of constructs and/or new associations focusing on the existing 
Conclusion
This study aimed to understand the past, present, and future of technology adoption and use research through systematic review of UTAUT2 literature employing citied reference search method. This resulted in classification of UTAUT2 literature into four types based on its usage: general citation, UTAUT2 application, UTAUT2 integration, and UTAUT2 extensions. The UTAUT2 extensions were found to be most promising for future researchers and further classified into seven types such as: new
