Living and Working with Service Robots: A TCCM Analysis and Considerations for
Future Research
Abstract
Purpose – Service robots are now an integral part of our living and working environment,
making them one of the hot topics for service researchers today. Against this background, this
paper reviews the recent service robot literature following a Theory-Context-Characteristics
Methodology (TCCM) approach to capture the state-of-art of the field. In addition, building
on qualitative input from researchers active in this field, we highlight where opportunities for
further development and growth lie.
Design/methodology/approach – This paper identifies and analyzes 88 manuscripts
(featuring 173 individual studies) published in academic journals featured on the SERVSIG
literature alert. In addition, qualitative input gathered from 79 researchers active in the
service field and doing research on service robots is infused throughout the manuscript.
Findings – The key research foci of the service robot literature to date include comparing
service robots with humans, the role of service robots’ look & feel, consumer attitudes toward
service robots, and the role of service robot conversational skills & behaviors. From a TCCM
view, we discern dominant theories (anthropomorphism theory), contexts (retail/healthcare,
U.S. samples, B2C settings, and customer-focused), study characteristics (robot type:
chatbots, not embodied, and text/voice-based; outcome: customer intentions), and
methodologies (experimental, picture-based scenarios).
Originality/value – This paper is the first to analyze the service robot literature from a
TCCM perspective. Doing so, this study gives (1) a comprehensive picture of the field to date
and (2) highlights key pathways to inspire future work.

1. Introduction
Service robots are omnipresent today. Their infusion with artificial intelligence (AI) and
increasingly cost-efficient and scalable nature allows service robots to be used to enhance
customer experience, service quality, and productivity, all at the same time (Wirtz et al.,
2021; Xiao and Kumar, 2021). Many people already interact daily with service robots in their
living (e.g., Siri, Amazon Alexa) and working (e.g., Pepper robot as co-worker)
environments. A recent report from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR, 2021)
shows the market for professional (primarily physical) service robots reached a turnover of
6.7 billion U.S. dollars worldwide. Top applications include delivery, cleaning, disinfection,
medical, social, and automated restaurant robots produced by over 1,000 suppliers
worldwide. Meanwhile, the global market for virtual assistants – e.g., Messenger chatbots,
Alexa, and Siri – was valued at 5 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 (Verified Market Research,
2020), with key players like Baidu, Google, Apple, IBM, Facebook, and Microsoft
dominating this space.
In this paper, we follow Wirtz et al. (2018) and consider service robots as system
based autonomous and adaptable interfaces that interact, communicate, and deliver service
to customers, employees and/or other (service) robots. This definition encompasses the wide
variety of service robot definitions and descriptions put forth to date (see Appendix A),
recognizing (1) the embeddedness of service robots within a network or broader system (e.g.,
connection to external databases, CRM cloud, etc. – see also Pitardi et al., this issue), (2) the
role of AI to enable service robot autonomy and adaptability (e.g., usage of emotion
recognition algorithms to adapt responses to customer queries), and (3) service robots’ ability
to interact with a variety of actors through various formats (i.e., interfaces), be they virtually
or physically (De Keyser et al., 2019).

Service robot research has grown extensively in the last years. Against this
background, this article seeks to paint a comprehensive picture of the state-of-art of service
robot research published in the area of service research. Building on 88 service robot articles
featured in the SERVSIG literature alert, we discern (1) key research foci and perform a
TCCM analysis (Paul & Rosado-Serrano, 2019) to uncover the (2) dominant theories, (3)
contexts, (4) study characteristics and (5) methodologies used to date. In addition, for each of
these five components, we discuss where future research may go building on qualitative input
of 79 expert scholars active in the service research area. Doing so, we hope this article may
act as a source of inspiration for the growing community of service robot scholars and
provide a foundation to develop strong and meaningful scholarly work.
2. Methodology

Management Information Systems, Journal of Operations Management, International
Journal of Operations & Production Management, Manufacturing & Service Operations
Management, Production & Operations Management. Our selection covered work published
in the period 2016- summer 2021.
We identified relevant articles based on a series of keywords, including ‘technology,
‘robot’, ‘chatbot’, ‘digital assistant’, ‘AI’, ‘artificial intelligence’, and ‘intelligence’. This
initial search resulted in a set of 2,145 articles. In a next step, all articles were manually
screened to see if service robots were the study's core focus. Papers with a generic focus on
AI and technology were kept out of the final set. In case of unclarity, the full text of the
article was consulted. This procedure resulted in a final set of 88 articles. All articles (and the
173 individual studies of which they are composed) were then coded following a TCCM
procedure (Paul & Rosado-Serrano, 2019) to extract their key theories, contexts, study
characteristics and methodologies used. In addition, we also coded the different research foci
to understand what major topics have been considered so far. Web Appendix A provides the
full references of the articles included in our analyses. Figure 1 provides insights into the
spread of articles across our timeframe.
Insert Figure 1 around here
In the following, we systematically discuss the various components – research foci
and TCMM factors – coded and complement these insights with a discussion on how service
robot research might move forward. We reached out to the 227 authors1 responsible for the
88 coded articles to fuel this discussion. Of this set, 79 service scholars responded – see
Appendix B for an overview of contributors who agreed to be acknowledged for their input 
resulting in a response rate of 34.80%. We contacted the authors by means of an email that

provided an overview of this article’s objective and included the 12 tables featured next in
this article. Through an online survey, we then asked our respondents a series of questions
about the opportunities and/or challenges regarding the identified service robot research foci,
theories, study contexts, the robot types considered, study outcomes, and methodologies. In
addition, we closed the survey with an open question allowing respondents to share any
additional considerations and comments. The specific questions of the survey can be found in
Appendix C.
3. Research Foci
Several distinct research foci could be uncovered in the coding process (see Table 1 for an
overview – we use the 173 studies as the basis for the count and relative frequencies).
Insert Table 1 around here
The principal stream of service robot research (48 studies – 27.75%) focuses on
comparing service robots with their human counterparts, be they employees or customers
(hereafter, ‘humans’ refers to customers and employees in general). For instance, Mende et
al. (2019) find that consumers may display compensatory responses when interacting with a
humanoid service robot rather than a human employee. Pitardi et al. (this issue), on the other
hand, find that service robots may in fact be preferred over a human frontline in case of
embarrassing encounters. Given the dominance of work opposing service robots and humans,
several experts raise the need to rather focus on the collaboration (instead of the contrast)
between humans and service robots in the service process. The following quotes illustrate
this:
“I think that the future challenges and opportunities lie in developing and understanding how companies can implement a smooth "omni actor interaction", that is, customers switching from a human to a non-human frontline employee (FLE) without having the feeling that one type of interaction is much better or much different than another. What are human and non-human FLE features and characteristics and

7
processes that allow a smooth and seamless transition from non-human to human FLE - customer interactions?” (Chiara Orsingher, University of Bologna)
“The dominant research focus so far seems to be the comparison between robots and humans. I feel the key opportunity to move forward would be to study the collaboration between robots and humans, rather than focusing on the differences. I expect that in the near future these actors work in a team, or at least in collaboration and it would be important to understand what the effect of this new type of actor is on service encounters and service experiences.” (Gaby Odekerken-Schröder, Maastricht University)
“I think there is an overemphasis on research trying to contrast robots versus humans. What we need is more research about robots WITH humans. How can robots and humans better collaborate? This is a really interesting question.” (Linda Alkire, Texas State University)
Therefore, future work may want to consider answering the following research questions:
How can we best nurture the collaboration between service robots and humans? How can
service robots be integrated within human-led practices? And under what circumstances are
service robots best fit to collaborate vs. substitute their human counterparts?
A second group of studies focuses on the impact of service robots’ visual look and
feel (27 studies – 15.61%). Of particular interest here is the extent to which a service robot
appears human. Letheren et al. (2021), for instance, find higher levels of humanness in a
service robot to increase consumer liking. Contrarily, Kim et al. (2016) find humanized
digital helpers to have a negative impact on consumer enjoyment in a gaming context through
reduced feelings of autonomy. Given these contrasting findings, several experts call for more
research to understand when humanizing service robots is recommended (and when not) and
to map the relevant boundary conditions. Also, more research is needed to understand how
different humanized robot features (e.g., the inclusion of hands, eyes, mouth, legs) impact
human expectations differently.
“A challenging issue that must be addressed is whether robots should, or should not, be more human. In general, we tend to think that they should be more human. But maybe robots have to be machine-like, and not talk and behave as do humans, because they are different in nature.” (Daniel Belanche, University of Zaragoza)

8
“In many papers there seems to be the explicit or implicit assumption that the more human-like a robot the better. This might be myopic as sometimes people might not prefer human-like robots with a high social presence” (Maik Hammerschmidt, University of Goettingen)
“Robot appearance also generates expectancy, which should be carefully managed. E.g., robot Pepper has hands. So, people expect that it can use them, while their practical use is in fact very limited.” (Bram Vanderborght, Vrije Universiteit Brussel – Brubotics)
A third stream of research focuses on consumer attitudes and perceptions toward service
robots (24 studies – 13.87%). Moriuchi (2021), for instance, finds performance expectation,
perceived risk, effort expectation, and social influence to drive service robot experience. Butt
et al. (2021) show how robot perceived ease of use and usefulness drive consumer attitudes
toward AI-powered avatars. Several experts express the need to investigate human attitudes
further and compare how attitudes change over time as service robots become more
integrated and common within society.
“In my thought, the "consumer attitudes & perception" are a key topic. Human-robot interaction analysis requires a different approach that recognizes that humans' relationship with technologies is multifaceted and context-dependent. Most technology mediates between the user and their worlds.” (Tiziana Russo Spena, University of Naples Federico II)
“It is more relevant than ever to investigate human-robot interactions to signify the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life. Subject and object constitute each other. It is not only a question of the interpretation of the humantechnology relations, but of engagement with the artifacts, the context of artifacts, and what the artifacts make available.” (Tiziana Russo Spena and Cristina Mele, University of Naples Federico II)
Further, 18 studies (10.40% of our sample) look at service robot conversational skills and
behavior. Gelbrich et al. (2021), for instance, show that emotional support offered by a digital
assistant may increase customer satisfaction and persistence in using technology-mediated
services. However, other experts raise the concern that service robots may not be ready to
deliver conversational skills at the desired level, leading to human disappointment. Therefore,

9
more work is needed to understand how customers/employees deal with failing robot
conversational skills.
“I think that the top challenge remains the robot's conversational skills and behaviour. Erratic behavior is what irritates consumers, impacting on consumer attitudes and perceptions towards robots, thanks to reputation.” (Emanuel Said, University of Malta)
Similarly, additional research may be needed to understand what humans are looking for in a
service robot, as well as to understand the boundary factors that drive their preference for one
set of robotic skills above the other.
“I don't think a robot vs. human comparison will be that informative in the future, but rather robot A vs. robot B comparisons. Robots will increasingly take over certain functions in service settings, therefore understanding what consumers need/want in robots will become increasingly important.” (Stephanie Noble, the University of Tennessee Knoxville)
“We need to find out how robots need to be equipped to be effective.” (Katja Gelbrich, Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt)
Another set of 9 studies (5.20%) focuses on service robot identification, which relates to
human actors’ (lack of) awareness of the artificial nature of a service robot during their
interactions. Luo et al. (2019), for instance, find evidence for a negative disclosure effect
leading to lower customers purchase rates in a financial services setting. This topic raised
particular interest with several of the experts:
“By now, the category "robot vs. human," has become overused. Conceptually, the more interesting and fundamental question seems to be, "What if robots can't be distinguished from humans but you know it is a robot. How will you evaluate the robot?” (Bernd Schmitt, Columbia University)
Future work may investigate how humans deal with the uncertainty surrounding the artificial
vs. human nature of the service frontline (e.g., Am I interacting with a human or a robot?)
and consider the extent to which human actors feel ‘tricked’ when realizing they interacted
with a service robot only after the service interaction took place.

10
Research also looks at the various roles service robots may perform (4 studies,
2.31%). Tuomi et al. (2021), for instance, identify service robots to take on a supportive,
substitution, differentiating, improving and upskilling role in a hospitality context, while Caíc
et al. (2018) distinguish six roles – enabler, intruder, ally, replacement, extended self,
deactivator – for socially assistive robots. Again, several experts note the need to develop a
better understanding of service robot roles and those of humans. For instance, while research
already considered changing employee roles – the employee as an innovator, differentiator,
enabler or coordinator (Larivière et al., 2017) – in a tech-dominant society, we know little
about how and whether customers take on new roles within service robot-dominated service
encounters.
“Recently, many studies have been conducted comparing how our perceptions change when various services are not provided by other persons, but by robots. Undoubtedly, these comparisons are very appealing. However, in my view, future studies should focus on identifying more specifically the roles, functions and the specific situations in which robots can provide a better service than humans or alternative technologies” (Carlos Flavián, University of Zaragoza)
“A key opportunity to move the field forward is to further investigate not only robot roles, but also altered or new customer roles that result from a robotic service agent. The opportunities and at the same time limitations that robotic agents have in comparison to human employees, might lead to new customer roles to be performed. Where service from human staff might be consumed in a rather reactive way because the human service provider takes the lead, I can imagine that more proactive customer roles could be essential in fully enjoying the service delivered by a service robot.” (Mark Steins, Maastricht University)
Our experts are also surprised by the lack of studies comparing service robots with other
service technologies (3 studies, 1,73%):
“It is remarkable that only so few studies have considered the contrast between robots and other technologies. Given that robots could be considered an upgrade from selfservice technologies, this would be quite an important area to dig deeper into.” (Jeroen Schepers, Eindhoven University of Technology)
“A key challenge lies in integrating service robots with other technological innovations and understanding their respective (dis)advantages and complementarities.” (Alexander Henkel, Open University)

11
As such, future work may want to focus on the differences between and/or interaction of
service robots with other service technologies that are rapidly gaining traction, such as smart
service systems (e.g., Henkens et al., 2021), augmented reality (e.g., Heller et al., 2021), and
virtual reality (e.g., Wedel et al., 2020); as well as how service robots relate to and lift
‘dumb’ self-service technologies (SST) to a next level. Here, Brengman et al. (2020) provide
some initial contrasting insights in a retail context, demonstrating a humanoid service robot
elicits 26 times more service interactions compared to a tablet-based service kiosk, resulting
in more unique customer transactions and spending behavior.
Finally, several other areas in need of research emerge from our expert panel. A first
topic is that of robot agency, relating to the level of autonomy and freedom service robots
(and AI systems in general) get to make decisions in name of their human counterparts.
“Another challenge is how people integrate robots into their lives. To what extent are customers able to live with robots at home, or let AI or robots take important decisions (e.g., about university admissions) or actions (e.g., conducting operations in a hospital)?”
(Daniel Belanche, University of Zaragoza)
The work of Huang and Rust (this issue) raises several interesting research venues, including:
Under what conditions do humans grant control to service robots/AI? And in what ways can
humans benefit from being substituted by service robots?
Another theme that surfaced is that of service robot ethics, with many experts raising
the need to carefully reflect upon the ethical challenges that arise from the implementation of
service robots:
“Humans should consider ethical issues as we literally begin to live with robots.” (Sungjun (Steven) Park, National Chengchi University)
“Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism is a big concern with digital assistants in the home, but this also applies to services (e.g., therapy bots).” (Russell Belk, York University)
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


12
Initial work by Belk (2021) discusses a variety of service robot ethical challenges
related to social engineering, ubiquitous surveillance, military robots, sex robots, and
transhumanism. Murtarelli et al. (2021), in turn, discuss ethical challenges linked to chatbots
and discern three key risks: (1) a risk of asymmetrical distribution of informative power (i.e.,
chatbots can collect and process information at a much faster pace), (2) a risk of unclarity
surrounding the identity, mental models and intents of the interaction partner (i.e., unclarity
about the interaction with an AI-entity), and (3) a risk of network security and users’ privacy.
From this initial work, it becomes clear that service researchers have a responsibility to
consider the various ethical challenges of service robots and providing more insights on how
we can deal with these from a human, firm, and public policy perspective.
A final theme is that of service robots in failure and recovery situations:
“I believe a key challenge is to identify robots' efficacy in service recovery. Does the service recovery paradox also hold in the context of robot-driven service delivery?” (Welf Hermann Weiger, Alfaisal University)
“How do robots and consumers react after a service failure caused by the robot?” (Sven Tuzovic, Queensland University of Technology)
Initial work by Belanche et al. (2020) shows that, compared to human employees, service
robots reduce customer perceptions of agent responsibility, especially in the case of service
failure, and increase firm responsibility. Choi et al. (2021) further show that customers are
more dissatisfied due to lack of warmth following a process failure caused by a humanoid
service robot (vs. a nonhumanoid). However, humanoids (vs. nonhumanoids) may recover
from failure via apology and explanation. Future work may look deeper into the roles service
robots can play at various stages of the service recovery journey, as well as how prone
service robots are to execute various service recovery responses such as apology, excuse,
justification, empathy, compensation, facilitation, and follow-up (Van Vaerenbergh et al.,
2019).

4. Theory
Current State
We identified 55 different theories and models used in the coded article set, while 21 articles
did not clearly specify a distinct theory or model as their foundation (see Table 2 for an
overview).
Insert Table 2 around here
Among the most used theoretical frameworks are anthropomorphism theory (18
articles, 20.45%), uncanny valley theory (9 articles, 10.23%), the stereotype content
model/social cognition theory (9 articles, 10.23%), social response theory/computers-as
social-actors (CASA) model (7 articles, 7.95%), social presence theory (5 articles, 5.68%),
and various theories looking at technology acceptance (technology acceptance model – 5
articles, 5.68%; service robot acceptance model – 4 articles, 4.55%%; unified theory of
acceptance and use of technology I and II – 3 + 1 articles, 3.41% + 1.14%).
Articles building on anthropomorphism theory investigate the extent to which people
perceive service robots as humanlike and how this impacts their interaction (e.g., Borau et al,
2021). In essence, anthropomorphism is a basic psychological process aimed at facilitating
social interactions between humans and non-humans (Blut et al., 2021). This facilitation
occurs through people assigning non-human entities with human characteristics. Service
robots appear to be particularly prone to this, more so than any other technology (Duffy,
2003). Anthropomorphizing service robots essentially helps satisfy two basic human needs: a
need for social connection and a need to control and understand one’s environment (Epley et
al., 2008). Blut et al. (2021), in their meta-analysis, find that anthropomorphism exerts a
strong and positive influence on customer intentions to use a robot.
The uncanny valley theory is widely used in robotics literature (Mori et al., 2012). In
essence, it suggests that service robots reaching a point where their human resemblance is

14
high but not quite perfect can make people feel uncomfortable, especially in comparison with
service robots that are more machine-like (De Keyser et al., 2019). While empirical findings
around the uncanny valley effect vary, Mende et al. (2019) find support that consumers may
react more favorably to service robots that are less human-like; this in contrast to Blut et al.
(2021) who posit anthropomorphism theory to better explain customer reactions to service
robots.
The stereotype content model (equally referred to as social cognition theory) suggests
there are two key dimensions to social cognition: warmth and competence (Fiske et al.,
2002). In other words, when people interact with another person for the first time, they assess
whether the other person has good intentions (i.e., warmth – being friendly, honest, sincere)
and whether this person can act upon these intentions (i.e., competence – being creative,
efficient, knowledgeable). According to Fiske et al. (2007), “warmth and competence from
basic dimensions that, together, account almost entirely for how people characterize others”
(p. 77). These two dimensions, in turn, may be equally used to explain the relation between a
human actor and a service robot (Yoganathan et al., 2021). Kull et al. (2021), for instance,
find that chatbots interacting through warm (vs. competent) messages lead to higher customer
engagement. Kim et al. (2019) find that anthropomorphism may increase perceived warmth
but ultimately decrease consumer attitudes through uncanniness, while competence
judgments are less impacted and exert a positive impact on robot liking.
Social response theory (Moon 2000) and the related computers-as-social-actors
(CASA) paradigm (Nass et al., 1994) hold that people tend to treat computers (and service
robots) as social actors, even knowing these do not possess feelings, selves and human
motivations (Nass & Moon 2000). In such a way, people use similar social rules such as
politeness, self-disclosure, and trust to interact with a robot (McLean et al., 2021). Tsai et al.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


15
(2021), for instance, confirm that people intuitively react similarly to chatbots as they do with
people.
The algorithm aversion model holds that humans may be negatively biased toward
AI-driven input (despite an often objectively better performance than human input) and show
aversion to it (Dietvorst et al., 2015). Longoni and Cian (2022), for example, find evidence
for a “word-of-machine” effect where consumers show resistance toward AI
recommendations in hedonic contexts, while AI recommenders are considered more
competent than humans in utilitarian settings. Furthermore, in a medical setting, Longoni et
al. (2019) find consumers to be reluctant to utilize AI-driven healthcare driven by a concern
that AI may not account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances.
Social presence theory stems from communication literature and relates to the ability
of a medium/channel to facilitate a sense of connection with another individual (Fulk et al.,
1990). Within a service robot context, the concept of social presence is mainly looked at to
understand the connection service robots may create with people (Schuetzler et al., 2020).
van Doorn et al. (2017) refer to this as automated social presence, reflecting the extent to
which robots (and other technologies) make people feel they are in the company of another
social entity (McLean et al., 2021). Schuetzler et al. (2020), for instance, find that increased
conversational skills, like a robot’s ability to tailor responses, may enhance feelings of social
presence. Odekerken-Schröder et al. (this issue) find anthropomorphism to positively impact
social presence, which then drives a service robot's utilitarian and hedonic value.
Furthermore, various models focused on technology acceptance may be found. The
most popular model is the technology acceptance model (TAM) introduced by Davis (1989).
This model, applied in a service robot context, essentially focuses on perceived ease of use
and perceived usefulness as two key factors driving users’ acceptance of service robots (e.g.,
Butt et al., 2021). The service robot acceptance model (SRAM – Wirtz et al., 2018) serves as
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


16
an extension of TAM into a service robot context and accounts for a variety of functional
(i.e., perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, subjective social norms), social (i.e.,
perceived humanness, perceived social interactivity, perceived social presence) and relational
(i.e., trust, rapport) elements driving service robot acceptance (e.g., Fernandes & Oliveira,
2021). Finally, papers building on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
(UTAUT – Venkatesh et al., 2003) as well as its later extension UTUAT2 (Venkatesh et al.,
2012) are building on a (sub-)set of key factors, including performance expectancy, effort
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions (UTAUT) and hedonic motivation,
price value, and habit (UTAUT2) to predict intentions toward and usage of service robots
(e.g., Moriuchi, 2021). We note, however, that most studies in our sample adopt a mix-and
match approach and may only opt for a subset of the relevant drivers identified through these
theories and/or combine them with other variables.
Considering the wide variety of theories and models used, several experts in our panel
view this as a sign of service robot research being in its early stages. As such, there is a
strong need to discern what perspectives are most insightful and how the field may move
toward an integrated theoretical model. This highlights the need for meta-analytical studies
(e.g., Blut et al., 2021) to integrate current, sometimes dispersed, findings and perspectives.
“Wow - what an amazing portfolio of theories! I actually believe it would be interesting to see which of these theories are most insightful; that is, systematic reviews and metaanalyses would be important next steps in my opinion.” (Martin Mende, Florida State University)
“As service robotics is still an emergent field and is primarily applying the theory of other relevant fields at the moment (with the exception of some specific theories, such as the SRAM). I have no doubt that more theory will emerge as the field grows and evolves, particularly theory that merges traditional service frameworks/models with the nuances of humanised technologies such as service robots.” (Kate Letheren, Queensland University of Technology)

17
At the same time, an extensive list of extra theoretical perspectives was put forth by our
expert panel. Among the most mentioned theories and models are theory of mind (Banks,
2019), consumer culture theory (Arnould & Thompson, 2005), the job demands-resources
model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007), robot intelligence levels theory (Huang & Rust, 2018),
self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), speciesism theory (Schmitt, 2020), service
dominant logic (Vargo & Lusch, 2004), construal level theory (Trope & Liberman, 2010),
actor network theory (Latour, 2007), and regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1998). Recent
work by Mariana et al. (2022) and Schepers & Streukens (this issue) outline several service
robots and AI-related research avenues in relation to most of these theories.
5. Context
Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 summarize the contextual factors discerned in the identified service
robot articles. The results (count and relative frequency) should be interpreted in relation to
the 173 individual studies reported in our set of 88 articles.
Insert Table 3 around here
Concerning industries (see Table 3), retail (22 studies – 12.72%) is most prevalent
(e.g., Brengman et al., 2021; Schanke et al., 2021) in our sample. This popularity is likely
explained by the wide adoption of virtual recommendation agents (especially in online
environments) and the introduction of physical robots in stores to help customer with simple
questions (e.g., Pepper Robot) and assist employees with such practices as inventory
monitoring. An equal number of studies focus on the healthcare industry (22 studies 
12.72%) and investigate topics like service robot-assisted medical diagnoses (e.g., Longoni et
al., 2019), health marketing communication (e.g., Tsai et al., 2021) and eldery care (Caíc et
al., 2019). Other widely considered settings are financial services (18 studies – 10.40%; e.g.,
Ge et al., 2021) and restaurant/food delivery (17 studies – 9.83%; e.g., Odekerken-Schröder

18
et al., this issue). Finally, the use of service robots in the home environment is receiving
increasing attention (12 studies – 6.94%; e.g., Letheren et al., 2021). This is not surprising
given the wide adoption of service robots that help with activities like cleaning, organizing
one’s agenda, booking meetings, and purchasing replenishments.
From our expert sample, various industries surface that may provide a fertile
environment for service robot research. These include education, childcare, sex work,
professional services, security, community services, as well as service robots in one’s home
environment. Moreover, future work may also consider the adoption of service robots in the
luxury industry, where the adoption of service technologies is slow but of undeniable
importance for new generations of digitally native consumers (Holmqvist et al., 2020).
“Sex work, childcare, elder care, banking, stock trading, military, education are important settings to consider” (Russell Belk, York University)
“A key setting overlooked in my view is higher education. In the pandemic most higher education institutions made a big leap forward in technology adoption to deliver their education, so exploring the role of robots in education is an emerging opportunity.” (Gaby Odekerken-Schröder, Maastricht University)
“I believe the luxury industry is missing, where the reluctance to use AI is based upon managerial perceptions rather than from the client side. The latter clearly demanding AI-led services.” (Phil Klaus, International University of Monaco)
When looking at countries (see Table 4), most studies are conducted in the United States (78
studies – 45.09%). The absence of Asian countries is unexpected given the wide adoption of
service robots in countries like China, Singapore, and Japan. However, we note that some
studies report having taken place in an Asian setting (e.g., Luo et al., 2019, 2021; Tong et al.,
2021) without specifying the country. Moreover, work in a European context appears to be
low in number (e.g., UK – 5 studies, 2.89%; the Netherlands – 4 studies, 2.31%), while
African or South American studies are entirely missing entirely in our study set.
Insert Table 4 around here
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


19
Building on these insights and our expert input, we posit that service researchers should
explore Asian contexts to investigate more developed and mature robotic markets. Similarly,
research is needed to understand service robots' (possible) deployment in bottom of the
pyramid regions. In addition, research on cross-cultural differences of human attitudes toward
and relations with service robots is of interest to advance our field.
“One of the key issues is that marketing robot studies seem to be conducted in the US and with US consumers mostly, while innovation and usage of robots — and the robot frontier — is in Asia." (Bernd Schmitt, Columbia University)
“I would expect to see also more papers in countries like South Korea, Japan and Singapore where the technology is more adopted and evolved that in the rest of Western Countries (like Europe and UK)” (Eleonora Pantano, University of Bristol)
“Developing countries are of interest, where robots might be used to avert local difficulties, such as lack of schools, healthcare, transportation.” (Luisa H. Pinto, University of Porto)
“Widening the countries that provide the sample respondents would also allow to investigate any cultural factors that may influence responses to service robots. This may be an interesting avenue for future research.” (Jeroen Schepers, Eindhoven University of Technology)
“To study the 'novelty effect' of robots, it may be an idea to compare regions where robots are already much further advanced in their lifecycle and much more adopted by and common to customers, to regions where this is not yet the case.” (Kim Willems, Vrije Universiteit Brussel – Brubotics)
B2C settings have been considered most (165 studies, 95.38%), with only a limited number
of B2B focused studies (5 studies, 2.89% - e.g., Figueiredo & Pinto, 2021; Mukherjee &
Sinha, 2020; Sowa et al., 2021) – see Table 5. In response, our expert panel calls for more
research papers focusing on service robots in a B2B setting (as opposed to industrial robots,
which have been looked at frequently in B2B studies). Moreover, several experts also noted
the importance of research in customer-to-customer (C2C) and government-to-citizen (G2C)
settings.
“I believe that the coming generation of service robots will first be used in workplaces by professionals rather than by consumers (e.g., in their homes), so more studies are
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


20
needed of robots providing B2B-related services (e.g., in offices and as support for decision-makers).” (Magnus Söderlund, Stockholm School of Economics)
“There is a need to focus more on B2B interactions and evaluate potential differences between B2C and B2B interactions.” (Luis V. Casaló, University of Zaragoza)
“What about C2C, and G2C services? Both could clearly benefit from an appropriate application of AI. I believe the use of AI to enhance the citizenship experience is underdeveloped. Given that most of us do interaction with government services, the emphasis should be on investigating this context in great detail. The impact for service researchers highlighting the advantages and guide governments towards 'best practice' of AI applications could be tremendous.” (Phil Klaus, International University of Monaco)
Insert Table 5 around here
Finally, we find that most studies are focused on the customer (155 studies – 89.60%), with
only 10 studies (5.78%) taking an employee perspective (e.g., Henkel et al., 2020; Paluch et
al., this issue; Tong et al., 2021) – see Table 6. The latter is surprising as frontline service
employees are often found in a collaborative partnership with their robot counterparts (De
Keyser et al., 2019). Even fewer studies take a firm perspective (3 studies – 1,73% - e.g.,
Mukherjee & Sinha, 2017) to consider how the adoption of service robots impacts such
things as internal processes and culture. In accordance, several of the experts stress the need
to consider the employee-side to understand how human employees react to and may develop
strong working relations with service robots. Furthermore, we believe that research is needed
to understand how internal firm processes should be adapted when integrating service robots,
how service robots impact the organizational culture, and what internal and external enablers
vs. barriers are driving/hindering their successful implementation.
“Although I fully share the excitement about customer-robot interactions, I believe there is a considerable potential and need to examine employee-robot interactions at the frontline as well as the 'backstage' where human service employees collaborate with robots.” (Martin Mende, Florida State University)

“I think much more attention should be paid to the employee. Their role will be dramatically affected by technologies such as service robots and much is to be learned about what is needed in terms of skills of the employee to perform well in this new role. What tasks will disappear and where can the employee still make a difference?” (Sandra Streukens, Hasselt University)
“Research on "cobots" will need a fresh impulse in the service discipline. Collaboration with robots is an important field of study, which can benefit from the extant literature in the service domain. The emergence of "cobots" will most likely more strongly affect B2B services, but not exclusively.” (Martin Wetzels, EDHEC Business School)
Insert Table 6 around here
6. Characteristics
In relation to study characteristics, we focus on service robot characteristics (see Tables 7, 8,
and 9) and study outcome variables (see Table 10).
Insert Tables 7, 8 and 9 around here
Looking into robot characteristics, we code information related to robot type (is a study
focused on a virtual or physical service robot?), robot embodiment (is the service robot
represented by a bodily instantiation?), and robot modality (what is the means of
communication of the service robot?). When looking at robot type (see Table 7), we note a
dominant interest in virtual service robots (103 studies, 59.54%), encompassing both chatbots
(e.g., Schanke et al., 2021) and virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa (e.g., Hasan et al., 2021).
Physical service robots like Pepper (e.g., Brengman et al., 2021) or Vector (e.g., Odekerken
Schröder et al., this issue) have been looked at to a lesser extent (42 studies, 24.28%). Next,
in relation to robot embodiment (see Table 8), most studies focus on disembodied service
robots (73 studies, 42.20%), which relates to interactions where the service robot is not given
a physical or virtual bodily representation (e.g., Luo et al., 2019; Mozafari et al., this issue).
56 studies (32.37%), in turn, focus on embodied service robots (e.g., Mende et al., 2019;
Jörling et al., 2019). This embodiment is almost exclusively human-like. Finally, in relation
to robot modalities (see Table 9), text (57 studies, 33.95% – e.g., Sidaoui et al., 2020) and
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


22
voice (49 studies, 28.32% – e.g., Whang & Im, 2021) are the dominant means of
communication considered.
Here, our experts raise the need for further research with a particular focus on
understanding under what circumstances different types of service robots may be most
impactful: When are voice (vs. text) interactions preferred from virtual (vs. physical) service
robots? Under what conditions do humans prefer embodied (vs. disembodied) robots? And
more specifically, what is the impact of varying service robot communication styles (e.g.,
formal vs informal tone) and linguistic features on customer and employee perceptions and
behavior, and does this differ between voice and text-based interactions?
“In understanding how people react to different robots, the types (physical vs. virtual) and modalities (text vs. voice etc.) are critical factors. People contact different robots for different purposes and with different motivations. While currently, a common motivation to use text- or voice-based bots is convenience (utilitarian motivation), there are some other factors that come into play, e.g., using voice-based bots out of enjoyment / hedonic motivation (this factor may wear of in the future as the technologies become more established). Furthermore, I can use virtual robots from the comfort of my own home, while most service interactions with physical robots will take place in-store / on-site. These contextual factors should be considered when comparing results of studies on robots with different modalities / different forms of representations.” (Nika Mozafari, University of Goettingen)
“Which robots work best in what service contexts? What (physical) form and skills do
these robots need to have?” (Bernd Schmitt, Columbia University)
Further, our experts are urging for more substantial insights on how different modalities
affect humans differently. Specifically, several experts point to a need for research on ‘touch’
and ‘movement/mobility’ as two underrepresented modalities of service robots. These may be
particularly important in service settings like healthcare (touch) and the military (movement).
“I am excited to see these overviews. I believe one inspiring approach is to examine how embodied robots move -- humans make numerous inferences about others based on their behaviors and movements; I am inspired by the idea of studying how aspects such as body posture, head and arm movements, etc. might affect service interactions. Similarly, I believe the idea of robots touching humans is interesting (e.g., in healthcare settings).”

23
(Martin Mende, Florida State University)
“Missing here is robot mobility (e.g., Boston Dynamics robots). I think this will have more importance than the modalities categorized already. Research in this area is needed as these robots begin to proliferate.” (Russell Belk, York University)
When looking at the outcome or dependent variables (DVs), we restrict our study set
to 140 studies that specify a clear DV or set of DVs (see Table 10). Our review shows that
most studies focus on customer-related variables. Among these, customer behavioral
intentions are dominant (52 studies – 37.14%), and include such outcomes as usage intentions
(e.g., Moriuchi, 2021), (re-)purchase intentions (e.g., Hasan et al., 2021), and intention to
follow robot advice (e.g., Longoni et al., 2019). Actual customer behaviors are measured less
frequently (14 studies – 10%). Luo et al. (2019), for instance, consider actual customer
purchases as their core DV.
Insert Table 10 around here
Our expert panel raises the need to focus on actual customer behaviors and consider
outcomes like service robot adoption, continued use, and purchase rates. In addition, financial
and market-based metrics may be highly informative and enable to determine the long-term
return-on-investment of service robots. Researchers may think of abnormal returns, stock
market performance, and market share before vs. after implementing service robots as
potential DVs.
“I feel that we need more research examining actual consumer behavior as related to service robots. That is, actual adoption, use, continued use, buying from, interacting with, time spent with, etc. should receive more attention.” (Jochen Wirtz, National University of Singapore)
Some type of actual purchasing data would be interesting. Do sales increase/decrease when a robot is present/serves you in a service/retail setting? I'd be most interested in actual purchasing data. (Stephanie Noble, the University of Tennessee Knoxville)
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


24
Furthermore, outcomes related to customer satisfaction/value (20 studies – 14.29% - e.g.,
Chung et al., 2020), customer attitudes toward service robots (17 studies – 12.14% - e.g.,
Borau et al., 2021), and customer preferences for human vs. robotic providers (12 studies 
8.57% - e.g., Longoni & Cian, 2022) are also prevalent. Customer trust (5 studies – 3.57% 
e.g., van Pinxteren et al., 2019), well-being (3 studies – 2.14% - e.g., Henkel et al., 2020),
and experience (3 studies – 2.14% - e.g., McLeay et al., 2021) are considered to a lesser
extent. Here, several experts highlight the need to focus on societally relevant outcomes, with
a particular focus on well/ill-being outcomes like perceived privacy intrusion and mental
well-being in relation to service robots.
“We need to include more societally relevant outcomes” (Dominik Mahr, Maastricht University)
“Investigations of well-being and trust have been overlooked in this research area. These are important outcomes to be emphasized in future research as they ensure the sustainability of business and society.” (Rajibul Hasan, Maynooth University)
Finally, several experts – in line with the low availability of employee-specific research 
emphasize a need for employee-focused outcomes:
“I miss the focus on employee related outcomes. Services sectors are facing labor shortages. Service robots can be a promising part of the solution to this by assisting human employees in certain processes or taking over some tasks entirely. However, what does this do with the employee experience, satisfaction and well-being? If the implementation of service robots has negative effects on the employee experience, it may crowd out even more human employees, further amplifying the labor shortages in services sectors where the human touch remains highly important.” (Kars Mennens, Maastricht University)
7. Methodology
From a methodological viewpoint, we code the methodologies2 used in the service robot
studies (see Table 11) and the way respondents interact with service robots (see Table 12).
Insert Table 11 around here
2 We adopted the coding approach of Khamitov et al. (2020) and De Keyser et al. (2020).
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


25
When looking at quantitative methodologies, the experimental method is by far the
dominant method used (110 studies – 63.58%). Here, scenario-based online experiments
conducted through platforms like MTurk and Prolific are leading (74 studies, 42.77% - e.g,
Pitardi et al., this issue), followed by lab experiments (22 studies, 12.72% - e.g., von Walter
et al., 2021). This popularity is not surprising given the ease by which experimental setups
can be used to consider how various robot configurations may impact human perceptions.
Field experiments are rarer, but still account for 12 studies (6.94% - e.g., Tong et al., 2021).
In addition, we find that 19 studies make use of a survey-based method (10.98% - e.g., Butt et
al., 2021). Together, several of our experts call for experimental work to take place in the
field. While scenario-based experiments have value to test causal effects and processes, they
may also lack ecological validity and generalizability (Willems et al., 2021).
“Field experiments would be valuable as they show actual behaviors. Theories can be tested in natural settings.” (Jochen Wirtz, National University of Singapore)
“Field experiments with randomized control trials and real human-robot interactions are needed more.” (Carlos J.S. Lourenço, University of Lisbon)
Qualitative research, on the other hand, is less prevalent overall, with only 13 studies using an
interview-based method (7.51% - e.g., Amelia et al., this issue; Paluch et al., this issue).
Many experts in our panel therefore strongly stress the need to adopt qualitative methods to
develop a deeper grounding of human interactions with service robots. Here, researchers may
consider in-depth interviews, observations, discourse analysis, laddering techniques,
ethnography, case studies, and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) as highly interesting
methodologies to adopt.
“Ethnography (which is more than just qualitative interviews and netnography) is sorely needed. More conceptual work is also needed.” (Russell Belk, York University)
“More usage of qualitative methods (including interviews and observations) would allow to explore more in depth the interaction between humans and robots”
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


26
(Eleonora Pantano, University of Bristol)
“Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), because of its features, could be particularly valuable in this domain for adding some new insights.” (Daniele Scarpi, University of Bologna)
“I'd like to see wider use of narrative studies and case theory: a scientific narrative concerned with how social actors produce, represent, and contextualise experiences. By merging explicit and tacit knowledge, researchers can draft non-linear narratives to grasp complexity as a way to generate theory. Narratives reveal the individual's retrospective sense-making of human experiences” (Cristina Mele, University of Naples Federico II)
Conceptual work is quite popular with 15 studies (8.67%) in this category (e.g., Huang &
Rust, this issue; Schepers & Streukens, this issue; Thomaz et al., 2020). Yet, more conceptual
work that supports the further development of a general theoretical framework underlying
‘service robots/human’ interactions would be of significant value to the field as pointed out
above.
The need for longitudinal work in a service robot context becomes evident and may
help overcome the drawback of the static view that is dominant in service robot work today:
“I think we need more studies looking at actual behavior towards a robot. What is furthermore needed is longitudinal research on how consumers change their behavior towards a robot over time.” (Jenny van Doorn, University of Groningen)
“A key research topic will the different embodiments and modalities of robots across the different touchpoints of the customer journey. This will require novel data collection approaches, such as eye tracking, text analysis, computer vision, voice analysis, facial expressions, EEG, and also new analytical techniques incorporating the unstructured and dynamic nature of the data. This will require looking across the boundaries of our discipline.” (Martin Wetzels, EDHEC Business School)
More complicated data, however, will also result in the need to use more advanced analytical
techniques like growth, hierarchical linear, and econometric models, allowing researchers to
move beyond the current dominance of ANOVAs, structural equation modeling and
moderated regression models. In this regard, much opportunity may lie in novel methods like
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


27
text, video, and audio mining (Grewal et al., 2021) to analyze the variety of data captured
through service robots.
“Novel analysis techniques such as neuroscientific and voice/text analysis could be valuable tools to tap into consumers' more deeply rooted processes. These insights could of course be equally important for virtual service robots, where the same methods could be deployed.” (Ruud Wetzels, Radboud University)
“Neuroscientific measurements seem an interesting avenue for further research in
combination with the internal interaction logs of service robots.”
(Malaika Brengman, Vrije Universiteit Brussel – Brubotics)
Equally important is to consider how respondents in a specific study interact with the robot(s)
under investigation. The dominant form is a picture-based format (50 studies, 28.90%), where
participants get acquainted with a service robot through a visual representation that is
typically supported by some explanatory text (e.g., Mende et al., 2019). Some studies go a
step further and make use of videos to aid respondents in imagining interacting with a service
robot (15 studies, 8.67% - e.g., Söderlund, 2021), while others make use of simple text-based
scenarios without any supporting visual information (19 studies, 10.98% - e.g., Longoni et
al., 2019). The latter is mostly the case for studies looking into disembodied chatbot
interactions. Interestingly, many studies also gather insights from respondents having actual
interactions with service robots (22 studies, 12.72%). Brengman et al. (2021), for instance,
employ an observational study design comparing the impact of a service robot versus a tablet
service kiosk on the point-of-sale conversion funnel. Also, several studies develop highly
realistic simulations of service robot interactions (24 studies, 13.87%). For instance, in one of
their studies, Kim et al. (2016) develop a short memory game where a helper robot appears if
respondents request help. Finally, 24 studies (13.87%) build on respondents reflecting on
their previous interactions with (specific types of) service robots in general (e.g., Fernandes
& Oliveira, 2021).
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


28
While all these options may be of value, real robot-human interactions inherently hold
the highest value. This is especially because it may still be hard for respondents of
experiments and surveys, for instance, to imagine their dealings with a service robot.
“Not all participants may have experienced these technologies in sufficient depth to rely on recollected/imagined experiences during research.” (Daniela Castillo, University of Malta)
Insert Table 12 around here
8. Conclusion
Taken together, and building on 88 service research articles published in academic journals
featured on the SERVSIG literature alert, we uncovered the key research foci to date 
robot/human comparison, the impact of robot look & feel, consumer attitudes toward robots,
the impact of robot conversational skills & behaviors – as well as the dominant theories
(anthropomorphism theory), contexts (retail/healthcare, U.S. samples, B2C settings, and
customer-focused), study characteristics (robot type: chatbots, not embodied, and text/voice
based; outcome: customer intentions), and methodologies (experimental, picture-based).
Moreover, following the input of 79 academic experts, we outlined several guidelines that
may support the further development of this burgeoning area. Table 13 provides a summary
of the key insights gathered.
Insert Table 13 around here
Moving forward, we see two additional challenges service scholars will be facing. A
first one is that of a short-term overpromise of service robot capabilities. Several of our
experts note that while the future looks bright, we need to be careful in overestimating what
robots can already do today and at what pace they will evolve and be implemented in
practice.
“Robots still speak to the imagination, but while in imagination, the sky can be the limit, reality is still far from there... When doing field studies, we often noticed passersby interacting with a robot and expecting more than what the robot is actually already
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4035662


29
capable of doing (e.g., voice-input in a noisy environment, real-time appropriate output on the spot, ...).” (Kim Willems, Vrije Universiteit Brussel – Brubotics)
A second challenge is that of interdisciplinarity. To make a lasting impact on service robot
practice, we need to connect to other disciplines like robotics, computer sciences, and
engineering and learn from their standards and methods. Again, this will require lenient
thinking from service scholarship, as some of our experts outline.
“A key challenge is to be able to integrate knowledge from other disciplines, like computer science and engineering. This is hindered by the academic standards that we use in assessing our publications in academic journals. Typical approaches from other disciplines are overruled by our own academic standards. We should be more lenient and try to think according to the other discipline's academic standards.” (Jos Lemmink, Maastricht University)
“A big challenge for the field is the valid operationalization of the robot/technology interaction. I think interdisciplinary research groups may overcome such issues better.” (Moritz Jörling, Emlyon Business School)
Hence, the service research field needs to open to reading work published in journals outside
their typical realm as this may provide new perspectives and insights (e.g., Computers in
Human Behavior, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, International Journal of
Artificial Intelligence Tools, International Journal of Social Robotics, Journal of Human
Robot Interaction). Future work may consider expanding our analysis and include service
robot work considered in these (and other) journals.
The future for service robot scholars is a bright and challenging one. It is our hope
that this article may offer a small contribution in the development of this field.
