I. Introduction

Humans have been searching for novel concepts and cutting-edge technologies to use since the beginning of time [1]. With the easy availability of reliable data, information, and affordable computer technology, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more relevant in a larger number of industries and facets of life. AI makes use of algorithms that simulate human intelligence to carry out cognitive functions and resolve issues through reasoning, learning, visual experience, and communication. Planning and natural language processing are two instances of cognitive tasks carried out by algorithms that simulate human intelligence. AI enables computers to learn how to analyze data or adjust to changes in the data. AI software automates tasks and boosts productivity, in addition to helping employees and business leaders make important analysis-based decisions. AI will drastically change preconceived notions and help make the industrial revolution possible. Human resource management (HRM) and AI have combined to increase efficiency, impact service delivery, standardize processes, empower managers, and change HR activities [2]. AI can be used for a variety of HR tasks. These include recruiting tools, intermediate applications, talent acquisition, attrition prediction, performance evaluation, succession planning, employee engagement, compensation, learning and development, and sophisticated AI solutions like biometric access, facial recognition software, and retina scanning [3]. The authors at [3] also used several machine learning approaches to determine what circumstances would lead an employee to leave the firm and, most importantly, to forecast the probability that a specific employee will leave the company.
