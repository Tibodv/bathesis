Abstract

This study tested the extent to which industry culture stereotypes influence job-seekers' Person–Organization fit when job-seekers inspect organizations' websites. We proposed that PO fit would relate to Person–Industry (PI) fit, which is the fit between personal values and industry culture stereotypes. Furthermore, a good website design should negatively relate to the use of industry culture stereotypes for assessing actual organizations, yet this relationship should be moderated by job-seekers' PI fit. Our hypotheses were confirmed. An organization's website design affects the use of industry culture stereotypes, but this depends on an individual's PI fit. Individuals use industry culture stereotypes when inspecting organizations' websites particularly if they find the website less attractive and if PI fit is low.
